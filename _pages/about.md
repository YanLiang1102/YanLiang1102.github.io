I work as an applied scientist in [Amazon Product Graph Team](https://www.amazon.science/blog/building-product-graphs-automatically) from 2018.

I received my Ph.D. Degree in [Computer Science](https://www.ou.edu/coe/cs) from the [University of Oklahoma](https://www.ou.edu/) 2022 advised by [Dr. Christan Grant](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/grant-christan/). Prior to that, I received M.S. in Computer Science from University of Oklahoma 2018, M.S. in Mathematics from University of Oklahoma 2013, and B.S. in Mathematics from Dalian University of Technology [大连理工大学](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalian_University_of_Technology) 2011.

I work in areas of information extraction specially in event extraction and detection during my Ph.D. time at OU. During my Ph.D. time, I developed approaches for quick labeling data across different languages. I developed topic-aware event extraction methods to scale up event extraction on different domains, with high improvement on few-shot event types. I developed scalable container based pipeline for event extraction with Kalman filter adapted batchsize. We published the largest machine-coded political event dataset covering documents from 1979 to 2016 (2TB, 300 million documents), known as [Terrier](https://terrierdata.org/). Here is my dissertation: [Scaling up Labeling, Mining, and Inferencing on Event Extraction](https://shareok.org/handle/11244/335586).
